/*
Akash and Vishal are quite fond of travelling. They mostly travel by railways. They were travelling in a train one day and they got interested in the seating arrangement of their compartment. The compartment looked something like 
WS 6 7|18  19|30 31|42 43
MS 5 8|17  20|29 32|41 44
AS 4 9|16  21|28 33|40 45

AS 3 10|15 22|17 34|39 46
MS 2 11|14 23|26 35|38 47
WS 1 12|13 24|25 36|37 48
 
So they got interested to know the seat number facing them and the seat type facing them. The seats are denoted as follows : 

Window Seat : WS
Middle Seat : MS
Aisle Seat : AS

You will be given a seat number, find out the seat number facing you and the seat type, i.e. WS, MS or AS.

INPUT
First line of input will consist of a single integer T denoting number of test-cases. Each test-case consists of a single integer N denoting the seat-number.

OUTPUT
For each test case, print the facing seat-number and the seat-type, separated by a single space in a new line.

CONSTRAINTS
1<=T<=105
1<=N<=108
